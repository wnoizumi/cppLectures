/* In this exercise you'll write a program which receives two numbers
 * and print the highest number.
 * Tip: Use the if statement and the >, <, >=, <= operators to compare the numbers. Example:
 * if (4 > 3) {
 *  cout << "4 is greater than 3";
 * }
 * else {
 *  cout << "3 is greater than 4";
 *}
